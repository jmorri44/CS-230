# CS-230
In this project, a client wished to create a cloud-based game app that was capable of functioning across multiple platforms. The application itself existed for Android already, but the client wished to explore other operating systems as a way of expanding their user base. While developing the document was informative, I sometimes found myself struggling to reconcile the client's wishes with the resources available at hand. For example, the client initially expressed a wish to port the application directly to several other operating platforms. While this was feasible in the case of porting from Android to iOS, porting to Linux seemed unlikely to be successful. 
I feel that I did a fairly good job in summarizing and interpreting the clients' needs, but I struggled somewhat with the implementation. The sheer volume of data available was often difficult to interpret, and I found myself being more vague than I would like because I lacked the specific understanding necessary to make a detailed recommendation.
I believe that the best remedy for my needs in this case is just experience. I am completely new to most of these computing concepts, and it will take time and experience for me to develop a feel for the 'best way' to do these things. As with any skill, the only way to get better is to practice.
